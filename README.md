# WebsocketChatApp
This is a chat application built using Websocket and Spring boot.

  Websocket provides effective communication between the server and the web browser. It provides bi-directional real time server/client 
  communication. This way the server can send message to the client anytime. It runs over Tcp and reduces overhead of each message.
  
  Spring Boot is an open source Java framework used to create a micro Service. Micro service is like a small application running its
  own service within the application. It can be easily deployed and is scalable. It needs minimum configuration and less time to build.
